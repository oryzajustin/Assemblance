## Winning game for Best Game for Mental Health

The reason why we chose to do a game like this is because some of the methods to tackling 
mental health are to provide a sense of community and have clear communication; it is especially important in our game,
since each player must communicate to understand each other's situation. These skills can be transmitted into our real
lives, and that's why we chose this game design as our take on the theme: "from the outside looking in, it's hard to 
understand."
