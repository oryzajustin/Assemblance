# Lojam2020
## Game developed at Lojam 2020

A 2 player online co-op game with a heavy emphasis on communication. Player's aren't able to see their own map, and must guide the other player to unlock doors and reach the end. Players exist in their own dimension - 2D or 3D - and are completely immersed in their own perspective. Keys are inter-dimensional objects that can be thrown between each player's dimension, and will transform to be 3D or 2D depending on the dimension it is in.

## Winning game for Best Game for Mental Health Awareness

The reason why we chose to do a game like this is because some of the methods to tackling 
mental health are to provide a sense of community and have clear communication; it is especially important in our game,
since each player must communicate to understand each other's situation. These skills can be transmitted into our real
lives, and that's why we chose this game design as our take on the theme: "from the outside looking in, it's hard to 
understand."

## How it was made

We used Unity to create the game, using C# for gameplay programming. We used Photon Engine as the multiplayer framework, which integrated into Unity through Photon Unity Networking. All assets were created from scratch, modeled in Blender, or hand drawn in Aseprite. This game was developed within 48 hours.
